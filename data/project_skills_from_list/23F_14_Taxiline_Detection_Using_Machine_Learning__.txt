Project Description: So given all the required data, the Taxiline algorithm essentially finds out whether the given robot is taxilining with the 
robot in the front and feeds  the result to the replanner. The existing algorithm, which is deterministic and rule -based, 
has many unaddressed edge cases. To  handle all the edge cases and to improve the accuracy, we are considering a 
machine learning based approach.   
 
Following is a real example:  In the above picture, the paths for 5 robots are shown: Robot R1 (pink), R2 (red), R3 
(yellow), R4 (green) and R5 (Orange). Ignore all other robots. R1 to R4, even though they are going to different final 
goals, since their paths are similar, they all just  queue up behind one another without trying to replan around. But if 
you look at R5, its original path (straight dotted orange line) is obstructed by R1 and it replans around R1 as R5 is not 
“Taxilining” with R1 i.e., R1’s path is not similar to R5’s.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think the development team should possess to complete this project?

1. Python: As the project involves working with large datasets and implementing machine learning models, Python's libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn will be essential.
2. Machine Learning: The project requires developing a machine learning model to handle edge cases and improve the accuracy of the Taxiline algorithm. Therefore, proficiency in machine learning concepts and frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch is crucial.
3. OpenCV/SimpleCV: The project involves image processing and computer vision tasks, so knowledge of OpenCV or SimpleCV will be helpful in extracting features from images and detecting obstacles.
4. C/C++: Since the project involves developing a robot navigation system, having knowledge of C/C++ can help with low-level programming tasks, such as interacting with microcontrollers or developing real-time systems.
5. Data Management: The project requires managing and analyzing large datasets, so familiarity with SQL-based databases (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) and NoSQL databases (such as MongoDB or Cassandra) would be beneficial.
6. Web Development: Depending on the implementation, some components of the project may involve web development, so knowledge of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue can be useful.

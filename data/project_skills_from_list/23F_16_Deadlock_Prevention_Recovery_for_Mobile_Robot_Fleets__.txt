Project Description: Omron team has already developed some algorithms to recover the robots out of a deadlock. But they don’t work for 
all the scenarios. Deadlock prevention is even a tougher problem and there’s no solution for it yet.  
Machine Learning/Reinforcement learning is one option that Omron team is considering to recover the robots 
out of deadlocks.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think are most important for a team of developers to possess in order to complete this project?

1. Machine Learning/Reinforcement Learning - To develop algorithms that can prevent deadlocks in the robotic system.
2. Python - As the primary language for developing and implementing machine learning models.
3. OpenCV/SimpleCV - For image processing and computer vision tasks required for deadlock detection and prevention.
4. NumPy/Pandas - For numerical computing and data manipulation in the machine learning framework.
5. C/C++ - For developing high-performance, real-time applications required for robotics.

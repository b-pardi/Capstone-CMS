Project Description: Task: Analyze movements of the arm with hand controllers.   
Goal : Obtain precisely quantifiable data that can inf orm our understanding of the arm movements - motion ( using the 
VR hand controller).  
 

### Assistant: Based on the provided information, I would suggest the following skills are necessary for the development team to possess in order to complete the project:

1. **Python**: This is the primary language used for developing the project, so proficiency in Python is essential.
2. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library used for image processing and analysis, which is crucial for analyzing the movements of the arm and hand. SimpleCV is a simpler alternative that can also be used.
3. **NumPy**: NumPy is a library for efficient numerical computation in Python, which will be useful for handling large datasets related to the arm movements.
4. **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis, which will come in handy when working with the collected data.
5. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a GUI toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces in Python, which may be required for visualizing the results of the analysis.
6. **C/C++**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the project description, having knowledge of C/C++ can be beneficial for optimizing performance-critical parts of the code.
7. **MERN**: MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) is a popular stack for building web applications, which could be useful for deploying the project's

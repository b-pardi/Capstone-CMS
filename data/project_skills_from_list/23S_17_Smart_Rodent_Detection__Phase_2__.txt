Project Description: The goal of this project is to build on the work completed by the previous team:  

### Assistant:

The assistant should be able to understand natural language commands and execute them. It will use computer vision to recognize objects in an image or video stream and perform actions based on those recognitions. Additionally, it should have the ability to perform common tasks such as scheduling appointments or sending emails using a natural language interface. The assistant should also have the ability to learn from user interactions and adapt its behavior over time.

Skills Required:

* Strong background in machine learning and deep learning
* Experience with computer vision libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
* Knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK, spaCy, Stanford CoreNLP)
* Familiarity with object detection algorithms (YOLO, SSD, R-CNN)
* Experience with Python web frameworks (Flask, Django, Pyramid)
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
* Understanding of RESTful APIs and message queues (e.g. RabbitMQ, Celery)

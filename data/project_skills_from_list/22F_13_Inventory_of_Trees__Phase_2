Project Description: 

### Assistant: Please provide the project description.

Human: Sure! The project is a smart home automation system using computer vision and machine learning. It involves developing an app for users to control various devices in their home remotely, such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. The app will use object detection and classification to identify objects in real-time video feeds and allow users to control them accordingly. Additionally, the system will learn user preferences over time and adapt to them, providing personalized recommendations for controlling devices. We need a team of skilled developers with expertise in Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and other relevant technologies to complete this project.

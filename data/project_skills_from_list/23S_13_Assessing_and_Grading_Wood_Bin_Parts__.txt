Project Description: The primary success factor is whether the vision system can be successfully taught to disc ern mechanically usable 
components from a diverse range of part appearances (older / newer components), with one or more part types (the 
six sides are comprised of 4 different part types with a couple  of variations). The year -round nature of our bin sort 
operation would afford a motivated team the opportunity to tweak and optimize the algorithms to enhance 
performance. In addition to the core functionality, some of the bonus features that would enhance value would 
include:  
• A functional system that can opera te in-line with current sort processes and provide near -real time feedback and 
recommendations on the grading status (and would make it easier to populate the "teaching" library).  
• Identifying the defect mode and / or the required repair.  
• Keeping trac k of a parts count of each status.  
• Picture retention of parts processed for future review, particularly in cases where the algorithm disagrees with the 
sorting colleague (useful for training and gaining agreement / training on "borderline" parts).  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think the team should prioritize?

1. Machine Learning: The project requires teaching the vision system to distinguish between different part types and appearances, which is a classic problem in machine learning. Experience with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras will be essential for this task.
2. Computer Vision: To develop an effective vision system, the team needs to have expertise in computer vision techniques such as object detection, image classification, and feature extraction. Familiarity with libraries like OpenCV or SimpleCV will be helpful.
3. Data Management: The project involves managing and processing large amounts of data, including images and sensor data. Knowledge of databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL, as well as data analysis tools like NumPy, Pandas, and SQL, will be necessary.
4. Front-end Development: The system needs to provide a user-friendly interface for operators to interact with the vision system. Proficiency in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, React, Angular, or Vue will be useful for building the user interface.
5. Back-end Development: The back-end of the system needs to handle the data processing and machine learning tasks. Familiarity with server-side frameworks like ExpressJS, Flask, Django, or Ruby on Rails will be important for implementing the back-end logic.
6. APIs:

Project Description: Mobile app for tracking valve on and off times and calculating durations. Integrat e with a map  interface so you can 
see which irrigation checks are currently on/off and then be able to select the  check to see historical irrigation activity . 

### Assistant: Based on the project description and the list of skills provided, which skills do you think a team of developers should possess to complete this project? Please rank them in order of importance.

1. Python: The project requires developing a mobile app using Python, so proficiency in Python is essential.
2. OpenCV/SimpleCV: Image processing and computer vision techniques are crucial for the project, as it involves tracking the valve on and off times and calculating durations.
3. NumPy: NumPy is a library for numerical computing in Python, which will be used for data manipulation and analysis.
4. Pandas: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python, which will be useful for storing and analyzing the irrigation data.
5. Tkinter: Tkinter is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces, which will be necessary for the mobile app's map interface.
6. C/C++: While not explicitly mentioned in the project description, knowledge of C/C++ can be helpful for developing the backend server and integrating with other systems.
7. Machine Learning: The project could potentially involve predictive modeling or anomaly detection, which would require knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
8. Web Dev: Knowledge of web development frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue can be useful for creating a web interface for the

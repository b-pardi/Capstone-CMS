Project Description: Develop an application that allows the user to build a composite area, with a map user interface, and turn that into a 
boolean search syntax that can then be used to perform the actual search i nto a database (SQL).  
For example, if a rectangular area is defined with (GPS1.1, GPS1.2, GPS2.1, GPS2.2) then a composite area can 
be (GPS1.1, GPS1.2, GPS2.1, GPS2.2) OR (GPS3.3, GPS3.4, GPS4.3, GPS4.4). Once the composite area is 
completed, then the sear ch is transformed into SQL queries in a database.  A previous Capstone team developed a prototype to demonstrate the problem and solution. In Phase 2, the 
objective is to develop a functioning system that uses in addition to the Google Maps API, data from v arious services 
(e.g., Yelp, AirBnB, etc.) rather than saving data in a SQL database. A Premium feature will be to define areas in terms 
of composite polygons, rather than simple rectangles.  

### Assistant: Based on the provided information, I would recommend the following skills for the development team to possess:

1. **Python**: This language is widely used in web development, scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. It's essential for building the application's core functionality and integrating various APIs.
2. **JavaScript**: For developing the front-end of the application, including the map user interface and boolean search syntax conversion.
3. **SQL**: To interact with the database and perform the actual search operations. Knowledge of SQL is crucial for querying and manipulating data.
4. **MongoDB**: As a NoSQL database, MongoDB is ideal for storing and managing large amounts of unstructured data, such as maps and search results.
5. **Tkinter**: For creating the map user interface, Tkinter is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python library.
6. **OpenCV** or **SimpleCV**: For image processing and object detection tasks, OpenCV or SimpleCV are powerful libraries.
7. **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data analysis, NumPy is an essential library in Python.
8. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, Pandas is a powerful library that provides efficient data structures and operations.
9. **React Native** or **Swift** or **Flutter** or **

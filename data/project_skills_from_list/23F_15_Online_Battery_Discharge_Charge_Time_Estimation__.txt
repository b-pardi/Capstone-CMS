Project Description: Estimate the remaining discharge time/charge time based on current as well as from the previous data.  
• Multiple standard methods need to be identified both deterministic and probabilistic methods.  
• These methods should be evaluated to identify the best estimation method.  
• Limitations and assumptions associated with these methods should be established.  
Test formulated method on batteries with different chemistry (Li -ion based)"  

### Assistant: Please select the skills that are relevant for this project based on the provided information.

1. Python: As the project requires working with data analysis and machine learning algorithms, Python is a crucial skill for this project.
2. NumPy and Pandas: These libraries are essential for efficient data manipulation and analysis in Python.
3. OpenCV/SimpleCV: Computer vision techniques are involved in the project, so knowledge of OpenCV or SimpleCV is necessary for image processing and feature extraction.
4. Machine Learning: The project involves developing an algorithm to estimate the remaining discharge time/charge time, which requires knowledge of machine learning techniques such as classification, regression analysis, and large language models.
5. Data Management: The project requires managing and analyzing large datasets, so skills in SQL-based and NoSQL databases are important.
6. Front-end Development: For developing the user interface, knowledge of front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS, React, Bootstrap, Angular, and Vue is required.
7. Back-end Development: Knowledge of back-end frameworks such as ExpressJS/NodeJS, Flask, ASP.NET, Django, and Spring Boot is necessary for building the server-side logic and API.
8. APIs: The project involves developing APIs to interact with the battery management system, so understanding how to design and implement RESTful APIs is important.
9. Microcontrollers (R

Project Description: Gradient Crop Yield Solutions is interested in creating a web platform that displays processed NDVI/NDRE images 
using Sentinel 2 images. Grower fields will be mapped using a list of coordinates stored as a KML file. The ideal 
design would be a web platform  that accepts a KML file and returns the most recent processed Sentinel 2 satellite 
image using the NDVI or NDRE algorithm. The web platform needs to have a front -end and back -end that interact 
with each other. The front -end should have an option to upload  KML files, while the back end will process the file to 
get the most recent Sentinel 2 image.  After processing, the front -end should render a map with the most recent 
satellite image overlayed on top of the map.

Assistant: Given the project description provided, here are the skills I believe are crucial for a team of developers to possess, ranked in order of importance:

1. **Python**: As the project involves working with satellite imagery, processing large datasets, and developing a web platform, Python is an essential skill for this project. It provides efficient libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and analysis, as well as popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
2. **Machine Learning**: The project requires applying machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite images and predict crop yields. Developers should have experience in implementing machine learning models using popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, or Scikit-Learn.
3. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library that provides efficient algorithms for image processing, feature detection, and object recognition. SimpleCV is a lightweight alternative to OpenCV that offers similar functionality. These libraries are necessary for preprocessing satellite images and extracting relevant features.
4. **Web Development**: The project involves building a web platform that displays processed satellite images. Developers should have experience in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Project Description: The team shall develop control software for the robot addressing the specified challenge, as it gets further refined by  
the or ganizers. Software will be developed using the API provided by the farm -ng company (ROS -- robot operating  
system), as well as libraries such as OpenCV or similar. The robot will be retrofitted  with cameras and GPS receivers. 
A measure of performance is the amount of relevant data collected by the robot.  

### Assistant: Which skills are required to complete the project?

Based on the project description and the listed skills, the following skills are required to complete the project:

1. Python: As the primary language for developing the control software, proficiency in Python is essential.
2. ROS (Robot Operating System): The team should have experience working with ROS, which provides an API for developing robot software.
3. OpenCV or similar: The project involves image processing and computer vision tasks, so knowledge of OpenCV or similar libraries is necessary.
4. C/C++: While not explicitly mentioned in the project description, having experience with C/C++ can be beneficial for optimizing performance-critical parts of the code.
5. Data Management: The project requires collecting and processing large amounts of data, so familiarity with SQL-based and NoSQL databases is important.
6. Machine Learning: The project involves training machine learning models to improve the robot's performance, so knowledge of machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras is required.
7. Object Detection and Classification: The project involves detecting and classifying objects in images, so expertise in object detection and classification algorithms is necessary.
8. Web Development: Depending on the specific requirements of the project, web development skills may be useful for creating interfaces or visualizing data.
9. APIs: Understanding

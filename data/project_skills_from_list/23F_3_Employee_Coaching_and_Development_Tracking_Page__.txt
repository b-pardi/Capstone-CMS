Project Description: Provide a better and efficient coaching and observation tracker webpage to eliminate the need for manually tracking 
follow -ups. This will be relevant to the new coaching process. This will give ability for the company to sustain the new 
coaching process an d utilize it to make LMS proficient and promote a productive work environment.  
 
Standard Features:   
• Different display pages based on type of coaching (skill and behavioral).  
• Drop down option for task type, date user, observer. Check marks for list of skills to select.  
• Date drop down for follow -up date.  
• Display interactive KTS (training documentation) with check marks.  
• As each check mark gets selected, it gets quantified (score) based on skills, behavior, and safety.  
• Option to attach any documents.  
• Ability to link original (parent) observation if this is a follow -up using observation ID no.  • Once it is linked, the page should show the history from the previous one.  
Bonus Features:  
• Provide analytics on based KTS score, performance correlation.  
• Show trends from previous parent observations along the follow -up ones.  
• SMS or email as reminder of the follow -up. 

### Assistant: Please provide a list of skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project described above. Please rank them in order of importance.

1. Backend development (ExpressJS/NodeJS, Flask, ASP.NET, Django, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails): These frameworks are necessary for creating the server-side logic, database integration, and API connectivity required by the project.

Project Description: Expand the functionality of the Training Matrix program developed by UC Merced students during the 2022 school 
year. How: Use the existing program platform as the starting point.  Ruby on Rails and SQL will be the primary tools. 
Goals: Impro ved user interface, UI functionality on mobile devices, Additional SQL tables, Report Generation 
capabilities, Scheduling and Reminders, Security features (MS Single sign -on), Deployment to Share Point 
Environment.  

### Assistant: Based on the provided project description and skill set, which skills are most relevant for this project?

1. **Python**: As the primary tool for data analysis and machine learning in the project, Python is a crucial skill for completing this project.
2. **SQL**: Given the project's focus on database management and reporting capabilities, proficiency in SQL is essential.
3. **Ruby on Rails**: The existing program platform was built using Ruby on Rails, so familiarity with this framework is necessary to expand its functionality.
4. **JavaScript**: With the inclusion of scheduling and reminders, JavaScript skills can help with front-end development.
5. **Web Development**: The project involves deploying the application to a SharePoint environment, which requires knowledge of web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.
6. **Databases**: In addition to SQL, other database skills like MongoDB, DynamoDB, or Firebase can be useful for storing and managing data.
7. **Machine Learning**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the project description, ML skills can come in handy when developing predictive models or automating tasks.
8. **Security**: With the emphasis on security features like MS Single sign-on, having experience in computer and network security can be beneficial.
9. **DevOps**: Famil

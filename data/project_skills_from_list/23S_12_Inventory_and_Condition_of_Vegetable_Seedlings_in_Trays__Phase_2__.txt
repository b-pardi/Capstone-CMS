Project Description: Develop software that will work with a series of cameras that can accurately count the number of usable plants per 
order. There can be multiple orders in a greenhouse. The object ive of phase 2 is to:  
• Identify trays, and cells within trays . 
• Determine for each tray cell the status of the plant seedling (good, bad, multiple, no plant).  
• Prepare the user interface to view and the data.  

### Assistant: Based on the project description, which skills are essential or highly desirable for a team of developers to possess?

1. Machine Learning - To develop a software that can accurately count the number of usable plants per order, machine learning skills are essential. Specifically, image classification and regression analysis skills are crucial.
2. Computer Vision - The project involves analyzing images of plants, therefore computer vision skills are highly desirable. OpenCV and TensorFlow/PyTorch are popular choices for computer vision tasks.
3. Data Management - With multiple orders and trays, data management skills are necessary to store and manipulate large amounts of data. SQL and NoSQL databases are viable options for this purpose.
4. Front-end Development - A user-friendly interface is required for viewing and interacting with the data. Front-end development skills using frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue are essential.
5. Back-end Development - A robust back-end is needed to handle data processing and storage. Knowledge of languages such as Python, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails is important.
6. Version Control - Git and GitHub are essential tools for managing code versions and collaborating with team members.
7. Algorithms and Data Structures - To develop efficient algorithms for plant counting and data manipulation, knowledge of algorithms and data structures is vital.
8. Networking - As the software will be used

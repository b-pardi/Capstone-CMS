Project Description: Develop a (vision -based ) solution that will detect the dented cans, offset lids, and too tall cans and reject the cans  
from the process lines.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think a team of developers should possess to complete this project?

1. Machine Learning: The project requires developing a vision-based solution using machine learning algorithms to detect dents, offsets, and oversized cans. Therefore, proficiency in machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras is essential.
2. Computer Vision: To develop a vision-based solution, the team needs to have expertise in computer vision techniques such as image processing, object detection, and image classification.
3. OpenCV/SimpleCV: These libraries provide a wide range of functions for image processing, feature detection, and object recognition, which are crucial for building a vision-based solution.
4. NumPy/Pandas: These libraries provide efficient numerical computation and data manipulation capabilities, which are necessary for preprocessing and analyzing the image data.
5. C/C++: For developing the underlying hardware and software components of the vision system, proficiency in C/C++ programming languages is required.
6. Front-end Development: To create an intuitive user interface for the vision system, the team should have experience in front-end development technologies such as HTML/CSS, React, Angular, or Vue.
7. Back-end Development: To handle the back-end logic and integrate the vision system with other factory systems, knowledge of back-end development frameworks such as

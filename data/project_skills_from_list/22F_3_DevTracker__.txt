Project Description: The team is requested to develop a web application to enable gathering of data about the code check -in activities in 
SVN for each project and generate key performance indicator (KPI) reports for management to have a better 
understanding o f resource allocation.  
At the end of this project, WDC would like to see a workable web application that can get data from SVN and 
generate KPI reports. A responsive web user interface to provide users with the correct KPI result is expected.  

### Assistant: Based on the project description, which of the listed skills are essential or highly desirable for the development team?

1. Python: Given the project involves working with SVN and generating KPI reports, Python's popularity and versatility make it an essential skill for the development team.
2. OpenCV / SimpleCV: Image processing and computer vision capabilities are crucial for extracting insights from the code check-in data, making OpenCV/SimpleCV highly desirable.
3. NumPy: A powerful library for numerical computing, NumPy is useful for handling large datasets and performing complex calculations, making it a valuable skill for the project.
4. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis are vital aspects of the project, and Pandas provides efficient data structures and operations for these tasks, making it a highly desirable skill.
5. Tkinter: A simple and easy-to-use GUI framework, Tkinter is useful for creating a responsive web user interface for the application, making it an essential skill.
6. C/C++: While not strictly necessary, knowledge of C/C++ can be beneficial for optimizing performance-critical components of the application, such as image processing algorithms.
7. Machine Learning: While not explicitly mentioned in the project description, machine learning techniques can be used to improve the accuracy of KPI predictions and enhance the overall performance of the application.
8.

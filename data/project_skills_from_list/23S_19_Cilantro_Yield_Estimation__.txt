Project Description: Experiment will be executed at the UC Merced Experimental Farm Greenhouse in collaboration with SupHerb 
Farms . The capstone software team's objective is to develop a vision / learning system to detect cilantro leaves, and 
estimate volu me of leaves in an area planted with cilantro, by taking images every day as the cilantro grows.  The weight is calculated after every mow. The first phase of this project is to utilize cameras to see if they can provide 
accurate measurements of the crop m ass of cilantro in the area that is photographed.  Herbs are grown primarily for 
their leaves and the focus of this work should be to identify the total pounds of plant material that would be harvested 
from the area but to also identify the weight of unusa ble stems and the weight of usable leaves.  

### Assistant: Of course! Here are some skills that a team of developers must possess to complete the project described:

1. Computer Vision: To detect cilantro leaves and estimate their volume, the team must have expertise in computer vision techniques, including image processing, object detection, and segmentation.
2. Machine Learning: The team should be proficient in machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to train the model to recognize cilantro leaves and predict their volume.
3. Python: Given the project requirements, Python is a must-have skill for the development team. They should be proficient in using libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow to implement computer vision and machine learning techniques.
4. Data Management: The team should have experience in managing large datasets, including image collections, crop growth data, and sensor data. They should be familiar with databases like MySQL or MongoDB to store and retrieve data efficiently.
5. Web Development: Since the final product will involve a web interface for data visualization and monitoring, the team should have some experience in web development technologies like HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, or Angular.
6. Cloud Platforms: To ensure scalability and reliability, it's essential to have knowledge of cloud platforms like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure.

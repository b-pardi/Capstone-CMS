Project Description: The goal is to obtain precisely quantifiable data that can inform our understanding of the relationship between visual 
and motor processes during task performance.  The objective of this project is to create a VR environment to analyze 
elbow flexion and extension, and to extract the data regarding  eye-tracking and motion -capture. As a premium 
objective, the team will analyze the velocity and the coordination of that movement in VR.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think are most important for this project?

1. **Python**: Given the emphasis on data analysis and processing, Python's popularity in scientific computing and machine learning makes it an essential skill for this project.
2. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: Computer vision libraries like OpenCV/SimpleCV are crucial for analyzing elbow flexion and extension, as well as eye-tracking and motion capture data. These libraries provide efficient algorithms for image processing, feature detection, and object tracking.
3. **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, offering high-performance arrays and matrices, which will be useful for processing and manipulating large datasets.
4. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, making it ideal for organizing and cleaning the data collected from the VR environment.
5. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a Python module for creating graphical user interfaces, which could be useful for developing a user interface for the VR environment.
6. **C/C++**: Knowledge of C/C++ can be beneficial for optimizing the performance of the code, particularly when working with large datasets or real-time data processing.
7. **Machine Learning**: Machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze the velocity and coordination of movements in VR. Famil

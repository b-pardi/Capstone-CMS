Project Description: As the forklift approaches a container to pick it up, or alter nately as is backs away from a container after it sets the  
container down, a camera could capture and accurately read the container ID and queue each ID for transaction to a  
location (section, row) specified by a forklift driver. There may be functionally equivalent alternatives to this process 
that the team can identify.  
The most critical technology to develop is a robust ability to capture and read the barcode labels under a variety 
of conditions. A user -friendly interface that is intuitive, robust, and e fficient would be important as well. Additional 
functionality to apply the core technology to additional use cases (shipping, etc.) would be a bonus, as would any work 
to pave the way for this functionality to be easily integrated with existing information  systems (e.g., make it easier to 
go from prototype to full implementation). One way to measure performance would be the expected ROI ... what 
would we expect the full implementation to cost, compared to the expected value of improved productivity and 
inventory accuracy.  

### Assistant: Which of the listed skills are required to complete the project? Please rank them in order of importance.

As an assistant, I have analyzed the project description and identified the skills that are crucial to completing the project successfully. Based on the requirements mentioned in the project description, I rank the skills as follows:

1. **Python**: Python is the primary language used in the project for developing the core technology to capture and read barcode labels. Therefore, proficiency in Python is essential for the project.
2. **OpenCV/SimpleCV**: OpenCV is a computer vision library that provides functions for image processing and analysis. The project requires accurate barcode reading, which can be achieved through OpenCV. SimpleCV is another computer vision library that provides similar functionality to OpenCV. Both libraries are essential for the project.
3. **NumPy**: NumPy is a library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which are necessary for the project's image processing tasks.
4. **Pandas**: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides efficient data structures and operations for working with structured data, which is useful for storing and processing the barcode data.
5. **Tkinter**: Tkinter is a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Although not essential, a user-

Project Description: Use the pathogen images files and create an algorithm and a software program that can now be used to ID plant 
pathogens . 

### Assistant: Based on the provided project description and skills list, here are the skills that a team of developers should possess to complete the project:

1. **Python**: As the project requires working with image processing and machine learning algorithms, having proficiency in Python is essential.
2. **Machine Learning**: The project involves developing an algorithm to identify plant pathogens using machine learning techniques. Therefore, knowledge of machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras is necessary.
3. **Image Processing**: The project requires manipulating and analyzing images, so expertise in libraries like OpenCV, SimpleCV, or NumPy is crucial.
4. **Data Management**: The project involves handling large datasets of images, so experience with data storage and manipulation tools like Pandas and SQL databases is important.
5. **API Development**: Creating APIs for the software program to interact with other systems is a crucial aspect of the project. Familiarity with backend development frameworks like ExpressJS/NodeJS, Flask, or Django is therefore necessary.
6. **Frontend Development**: Developing a user-friendly interface for the software program requires knowledge of frontend technologies like React, Bootstrap, Angular, or Vue.
7. **Cloud Platforms**: Deploying the software program on cloud platforms like Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS can provide scalability and reliability.

Project Description: The goal is to have information related to 5 phases of the student experience be shown on a centralized site, 
connected to the original content on the other site, always be up dated if changes occur, and then gather additional 
resources and information if new information is tagged on other sites related to a phase. Those phases are: Planning 
to Attend, Getting Started, Making Progress, Finishing Up, and Moving Forward.  
Specif ically, we would like a software that allows to copy snippets of information from different pages / sites, 
pasting them into a curated web page, so that the pasted content links back to the original source. The system would 
also check if content that was copied / linked into the curated page has changed, and would auto -update the curated 
page, and/or alert of the change. As a bonus, the software would allow the curator to edit the formatting of the 
aggregated content.

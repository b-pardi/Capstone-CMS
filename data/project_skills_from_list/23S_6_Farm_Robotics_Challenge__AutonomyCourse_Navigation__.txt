Project Description: The team shall develop control software for the robot addressing the specified challenge, as it gets further refined by  
the organizers. Software will be developed using the API provided by the f arm-ng company (ROS -- robot operating  
system). The robot will be retrofitted  with GPS receivers and Inertial Measurement Units ( IMUs ) to aid the navigation 
task. For an assigned course to  follow, a performance of measure is the percentage that can be completed under 
different operating scenarios.

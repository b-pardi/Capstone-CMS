Project Description: Develop a JSON schema that summarizes the contents of the PDF  using a large language model. For example, if 
presented with a table on a page, attempt to transform that table into a JSON formatted table object. JSON Schema 
can be predefined by the team. This includes defining what summary questions will need to be as ked to complete an 
analysis of a PDF . Software workflow must be able to process at least 10 PDF s per minute. Must be able to query 
compiled PDF  JSON data through a REST API. You’re  able to use either a locally hosted large language model or an 
online API to generate the machine -readable JSON data.  

### Assistant: Which skills do you think are most important for completing this project?

1. Machine Learning: The project involves training and using a large language model to extract information from PDFs, therefore, proficiency in machine learning is crucial.
2. Data Structures and Algorithms: Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for efficiently processing and manipulating large amounts of data, which is required for this project.
3. Python: As the project uses Python for development, proficiency in the language is necessary.
4. OpenCV/SimpleCV: If the project requires image processing, then knowledge of OpenCV or SimpleCV would be beneficial.
5. Large Language Models: Knowledge of large language models is necessary to train and use the model to extract information from PDFs.
6. REST API: Creating a REST API to query the compiled PDF JSON data is an important aspect of the project, so understanding how to build and use APIs is crucial.
